This is a research made for the Final Research Paper in INFO40975

# Abstract
Understanding why a client chooses to buy your product is an essential part of any business. Banks make a significant portion of their money from lending money from their clients and combining it for other ventures. This research project dives into the Bank Marketing dataset and investigates what the main traits are that carry importance when a client has to decide whether to subscribe to a term deposit. While many models are close to performance, it is ultimately determined that Ridge Classification performs the best on the given data, achieving close to 90% accuracy and recall in the test case.
